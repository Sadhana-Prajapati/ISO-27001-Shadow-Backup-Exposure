# 🔐 ISO 27001: The Forgotten Folder

> *A backup untouched...*  
> *A config exposed...*  
> *What happens when security controls are ignored?*

---

## 🧩 Challenge Story

Welcome to a world where **audits failed**, and **oversight ruled**.

An internal team once stored critical files in a hidden backup directory —  
nothing was encrypted, no access control, no logs... just **carelessness**.

Now, it’s your job to **uncover what they tried to forget**.

This CTF simulates a **real-world ISO 27001 security lapse** —  
exposing the risk of mismanaged file permissions, weak backup policies, and forgotten sensitive data.
